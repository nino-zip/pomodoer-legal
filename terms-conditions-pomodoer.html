    <h1>Terms and Conditions – Pomodoer</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-06-22</p>
    <p>
      These terms and conditions apply to the Pomodoer app (hereby referred to
      as “Application”) for mobile devices created by nino.zip94 (hereafter
      “Service Provider”) as a Freemium service.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these
      terms. Please read them carefully. Unauthorized copying, modification,
      extraction of source code, or creation of derivative works is prohibited.
      Intellectual property rights remain with the Service Provider.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payment</h2>
    <p>
      Pomodoer includes free and premium features available through in-app
      purchases. PRO features include Focus Mode, analytics, 8+ custom timers,
      double rewards, and ad removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled 24 hours before the end
      of the current billing period. Subscriptions can be managed via your Apple
      ID settings.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Usage and Restrictions</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse the Application. The Service Provider advises
      against jailbreaking/rooting your device, which may compromise security or
      break functionality.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Liability and Connectivity</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider is not responsible for app malfunctions due to lack
      of internet, low battery, or unsupported OS versions. You are responsible
      for any network or roaming charges incurred while using the Application.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Updates and Termination</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may be updated to maintain compatibility or enhance
      functionality. Updates may be required to continue use. The Service
      Provider reserves the right to discontinue the Application at any time
      without notice.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Data &amp; Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may process limited usage data or use third-party tools
      (e.g. RevenueCat) for subscriptions. See our
      <a href="privacy-policy-pomodoer.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      Pomodoer is a tool for productivity. Results may vary. The Service
      Provider does not guarantee specific outcomes or results.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may update these terms periodically. Continued use of
      the Application implies acceptance of these changes.
